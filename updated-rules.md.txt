# Greed Dice Game

### Official Rules

Greed is a fast, high‑risk dice game for 2 or more players. Players push their luck to build large scores, knowing that one bad roll can wipe out an entire turn—or even hand a valuable opportunity to the next player.

The object of the game is to be the player with the **highest total score** when the game ends.

---

## Equipment

* Five six‑sided dice
* Paper and pencil for scoring

---

## Objective

* Be the first player to reach the **target score** (default: **10,000 points**).
* Once the target score is reached, all other players get **one final turn**.
* The highest total score after the final round wins.

---

## Getting Into the Game

* A player must score **at least 600 points in a single turn** to get “on the board.”
* Points scored before meeting this requirement do **not** count.
* Points gained from a carryover (see below) **cannot** be used to enter the game.

---

## Turn Overview

On your turn:

1. Roll the dice available to you.
2. Set aside (keep) one or more scoring dice.
3. Add their value to your turn score.
4. Either roll the remaining dice again or stop and bank your points. **You may only bank points during a turn in which you have already met the entry requirement (see Getting Into the Game).**

At least **one scoring die must be kept on every roll**.

If at any time you roll and **do not roll a 1, a 5, or a valid scoring combination**, your turn ends immediately and you score **zero points for the entire turn**.

### Single Dice

* Each **1** is worth **100 points**.
* Each **5** is worth **50 points**.

No other single dice score points by themselves.

---

### Scoring Combinations

(All combinations must be rolled in a single roll.)

* Three 1s = 1000 points

* Three 2s = 200 points

* Three 3s = 300 points

* Three 4s = 400 points

* Three 5s = 500 points

* Three 6s = 600 points

* Four of a kind (any number) = **double** the matching three‑of‑a‑kind value

  * Examples: 4×1s = 2000; 4×5s = 1000; 4×6s = 1200

* Five of a kind = **double** the matching four‑of‑a‑kind value

  * Example: 5×6s = 2400

* **Small Straight** (1‑2‑3‑4 or 2‑3‑4‑5) = 750 points

  * A small straight may be scored **along with** an extra single 1 or 5, if present.

* **Large Straight** (1‑2‑3‑4‑5 **or** 2‑3‑4‑5‑6) = 1500 points

  * Uses all five dice; no additional single scoring applies.

---

### Partial Combinations

* Players may keep any dice they wish.
* **A combination only scores if all required dice are kept.**
* If you keep only part of a possible combination, that combination does not score.
* Only 1s and 5s score as singles.

**Example:**

* Roll: 2‑2‑2‑5‑6

  * Keeping all three 2s scores 200 points.
  * Keeping only two 2s scores nothing.
  * Keeping the 5 alone scores 50 points.
  * Keeping all three 2s and the 5 scores 250 points. 

---

## Hot Dice

* If you score using **all five dice**, you receive **five fresh dice** and may continue your turn.

---

## Ending a Turn Voluntarily

* You may stop rolling at any time **during a turn in which you are already on the board** and bank your turn score.
* If you have not yet met the entry requirement, you must continue rolling until you either qualify or bust.
* If you stop while you still have dice remaining, a **carryover opportunity** is created for the next player.

---

## Carryover Rule

If a player ends their turn with dice remaining:

* They bank their points immediately.
* The **next player** may either attempt to build on that score by rolling the remaining dice, or decline the carryover entirely. If the carryover is declined, it is immediately lost.

### Carryover Attempt

* The next player must roll the leftover dice.
* If the roll contains **at least one 1 or 5**, the carryover is successful:

  * The next player starts their turn with the previous player’s score as their base + plus the value that they rolled with the remaining dice. 
  * They continue playing normally from there.
* If the roll contains **no 1 and no 5**:

  * The turn ends immediately.
  * The player scores zero.
  * The carryover opportunity is lost and does not pass to any other player.

**Example:**

* Player A ends their turn with 1500 points and 2 dice unrolled.
* Player B rolls those 2 dice.

  * If B rolls 1‑2, they now have 1600 points and may continue.
  * If B rolls 4-5, they now have 1550 points and may continue
  * If B rolls 1‑5, they now have 1650 points; since all remaining dice were scored, **hot dice applies** and B continues with five fresh dice.
  * If B rolls 2‑3, their turn ends immediately with zero points.

A player may not bank immediately after a successful carryover roll; they must first score at least one 1 or 5.

---

## Bust

* If you roll and score **no 1, no 5, and no valid scoring combination**, your turn ends immediately.
* You lose **all points accumulated during that turn**.

---

## End of the Game

* When a player reaches **10,000**, that score becomes the **score to beat**.
* All other players get **one full turn** to try to beat it.
* If no one beats the score, that player wins.
* If someone **does** beat it, the new score becomes the score to beat and all other players again get one turn.
* This continues until a round ends with no new high score.

### Tie-Breaker

* If players are tied for the highest score, **the player who reached that score first wins**.

**Greed favors courage.
Greed punishes hesitation.
Choose wisely.**
